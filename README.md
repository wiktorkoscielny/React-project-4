# Recruitment task

Simple recruitment task from Ben Awad YT [video](https://youtu.be/gnkrDse9QKc)
Task for begginer React.js developer.

I have used 2 function components to make counter and to get data from fake api.

1. In second case i have used useState, useEffect, and async function to get fake [data](https://randomuser.me/api)
2. I know that there is some different ways to get data from api like fetch, simply custom hook or hooks like useFetch, useQuery, but I found the way i did this the more efficient.
3. I displayed the data in different ways(just everything from Json, then only one element from array, and finally I have mapped throught array displaying chosen elements)
4. Additionaly I changed colors to be more eye-friendly using styled components.
